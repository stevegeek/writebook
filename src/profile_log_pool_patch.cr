# Splits Marten's `Connection::Base#open` into two timings:
#
#   pool_wait  : time spent inside `using_connection` *before* the
#                application block runs — i.e. waiting for a free
#                connection from the crystal-db pool.
#   query_exec : time inside the application block (driver round-trip +
#                result-set hydration).
#
# A call made inside an existing transaction skips the pool checkout
# (reuses the transaction's connection); its wait is recorded as 0 and
# everything is folded into `query_exec`.
#
# Each call appends `(wait_ms, exec_ms)` to a per-fiber tally that
# ProfileLog dumps as part of the request's finish line, e.g.:
#
#   pool_wait_total=423.1ms pool_wait_max=210.4ms
#   db_calls=6 query_exec_total=58.2ms
#
# That tells us at a glance whether the un-instrumented gap in a slow
# request is sitting in pool wait (vs render or other CPU work).
#
# Runtime-gated against `ProfileLog.enabled?` so a non-PROFILE build
# only pays a single branch per db.open call.
